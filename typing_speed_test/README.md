# Typing Speed Test Application

## Overview
An intermediate-level Python program that tests and evaluates your typing speed (WPM - Words Per Minute), accuracy, and error count. The application presents random text samples for you to type and provides detailed performance metrics.

## Features
- Measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)
- Calculates typing accuracy percentage
- Counts character-level mistakes
- Multiple pre-defined test texts
- Performance feedback based on results
- Simple command-line interface

## Difficulty Level
- **Intermediate Python** (uses functions, time handling, string operations, and basic algorithms)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- time module (standard library)
- random module (standard library)

## Installation & Usage

### Method 1: Clone Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/bhargavatejagolla/pyverse/blob/main/typing_speed_test/README.md]
   cd typing-speed-test
   ```
2. ### Run the script:
   python typing_speed_test.py
3. ### Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Read the displayed text carefully

   - Type the text exactly as shown
 
   - Press Enter when finished

   - View your results!
4. ### How It Works 

- Randomly selects one of several text samples  
- Waits for you to type the text as accurately as possible  
- Calculates the following:

  - **Typing Speed (WPM)**
  - **Time Taken**
  - **Number of Errors**
  - **Accuracy Percentage**

- Provides motivational feedback based on your performance
5. ### Example Output 
<h3>------------------ TYPING TEST --------------------------</h3>

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Start typing the above text. Press ENTER when done.

Type here: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

<h2>------------------ RESULTS --------------------------</h2>
Typing Speed: 45.32 WPM
Time Taken: 6.54 seconds
Errors: 0
Accuracy: 100.0%
<h2>----------------------------------------------------</h2>
üî• Great job! You're a fast and accurate typist!
## Customization üõ†Ô∏è

You can easily customize the typing test:

-  Add more test texts by editing the `test` list in the code  
-  Adjust the accuracy thresholds for feedback messages  
-  Change the calculation method for WPM if desired
